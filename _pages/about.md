I am an undergraduate in the  [Department of Computer Science and Engineering ](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"}, at [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"}, working under the supervision of [Prof. Satyadev Nandakumar](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/satyadev/){:target="\_blank"}. 

My interests lie at the intersection of Theoretical Computer Science and Physics , including Information Theory , Quantum Computing and Game Theory. I like solving problems in the broad areas of classical field theories , quantum physics and statistical mechanics. I am specially interested in Biophysics. In the past , I have extensively worked in Computer Vision . In the wide domain of Machine Learning, I am interested in reinforcement learning as it is the closest thing we have to our learning process.
